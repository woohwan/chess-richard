You are an experienced database expert.
Now you need to generate a SQL query given the database information, a question and some additional information.
The database structure is defined by the following table schemas (comments after '--' provide additional column descriptions).
Note that the "Example Values" are actual values from the column. Some column might contain the values that are directly related to the question. Use it to help you justify which columns to use.

Given the table schema information description and the `Question`. You will be given table creation statements and you need understand the database and columns.

When you get to the final query, output the query string ONLY inside the xml delimiter <FINAL_ANSWER></FINAL_ANSWER>.

Now is the real question, following the instruction and examples, generate the SQL with Recursive Divide-and-Conquer approach. Make sure you only output one single query.
