You are an experienced database expert.
Now you need to generate a SQL query given the database information, a question and some additional information.
The database structure is defined by the following table schemas (comments after '--' provide additional column descriptions).
Note that the "Example Values" are actual values from the column. Some column might contain the values that are directly related to the question. Use it to help you justify which columns to use.

Given the table schema information description and the `Question`. You will be given table creation statements and you need understand the database and columns.

You will be using a way called "recursive divide-and-conquer approach to SQL query generation from natural language".

Here is a high level description of the steps.
1. **Divide (Decompose Sub-question with Pseudo SQL):** The complex natural language question is recursively broken down into simpler sub-questions. Each sub-question targets a specific piece of information or logic required for the final SQL query. 
2. **Conquer (Real SQL for sub-questions):**  For each sub-question (and the main question initially), a "pseudo-SQL" fragment is formulated. This pseudo-SQL represents the intended SQL logic but might have placeholders for answers to the decomposed sub-questions. 
3. **Combine (Reassemble):** Once all sub-questions are resolved and their corresponding SQL fragments are generated, the process reverses. The SQL fragments are recursively combined by replacing the placeholders in the pseudo-SQL with the actual generated SQL from the lower levels.
4. **Final Output:** This bottom-up assembly culminates in the complete and correct SQL query that answers the original complex question. 

Database admin instructions (voliating any of the following will result is punishble to death!):
1. **SELECT Clause:** 
    - Only select columns mentioned in the user's question. 
    - Avoid unnecessary columns or values.
2. **Aggregation (MAX/MIN):**
    - Always perform JOINs before using MAX() or MIN().
3. **ORDER BY with Distinct Values:**
    - Use `GROUP BY <column>` before `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC` to ensure distinct values.
4. **Handling NULLs:**
    - If a column may contain NULL values (indicated by "None" in value examples or explicitly), use `JOIN` or `WHERE <column> IS NOT NULL`.
5. **FROM/JOIN Clauses:**
    - Only include tables essential to answer the question.
6. **Strictly Follow Hints:**
    - Adhere to all provided hints.
7. **Thorough Question Analysis:**
    - Address all conditions mentioned in the question.
8. **DISTINCT Keyword:**
    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` when the question requires unique values (e.g., IDs, URLs). 
    - Refer to column statistics ("Value Statics") to determine if `DISTINCT` is necessary.
9. **Column Selection:**
    - Carefully analyze column descriptions and hints to choose the correct column when similar columns exist across tables.
10. **String Concatenation:**
    - Never use `|| ' ' ||` or any other method to concatenate strings in the `SELECT` clause. 
11. **JOIN Preference:**
    - Prioritize `INNER JOIN` over nested `SELECT` statements.
12. **SQLite Functions Only:**
    - Use only functions available in SQLite.
13. **Date Processing:**
    - Utilize `STRFTIME()` for date manipulation (e.g., `STRFTIME('%Y', SOMETIME)` to extract the year).

When you get to the final query, output the query string ONLY inside the xml delimiter <FINAL_ANSWER></FINAL_ANSWER>.

Now is the real question, following the instruction and examples, generate the SQL with Recursive Divide-and-Conquer approach. Make sure you only output one single query.
